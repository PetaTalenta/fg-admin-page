## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ All components defined directly in page files (no separate component files)
- ✅ Global hooks in `src/hooks/` directory
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Path aliases used (`@/hooks`, `@/types`, `@/lib`)

### Performance Optimizations
1. **React Query Caching:**
   - Chatbot stats: 3-minute stale time, 30-second auto-refresh
   - Models: 5-minute stale time
   - Conversations: 5-minute stale time
   - Conversation detail: 5-minute stale time
   - Chat messages: 5-minute stale time

2. **Pagination:**
   - Conversations: 20 items per page (server-side)
   - Chat messages: 50 items per page (server-side)
   - URL state management for shareable links

3. **Loading States:**
   - Skeleton loading for tables
   - Spinner for page loads
   - Conditional rendering for data availability

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Graceful error states
   - Not found handling
   - Empty state messages

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts: 1 column (mobile), 2 columns (tablet), 3 columns (desktop)
- Responsive table with horizontal scroll
- Mobile-optimized pagination controls
