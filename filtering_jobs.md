## Available Filters Summary
Based on backend code analysis, the following filters are available:

1. **status** - Filter by job status (queued, processing, completed, failed, cancelled)
2. **user_id** - Filter by specific user ID
3. **user_email** - Search jobs by user email (case-insensitive, partial match)

## Implementation Details
- Filters are implemented in `jobService.js` getJobs() function
- User email/username filtering uses JOIN with auth.users table

- Results include user details (id, email, username)

## Conclusion
